## 📦 Types of Data Structures

### 1. Linear Data Structures
| Structure   | Description                                    | Example Languages       |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Array       | Fixed size, same type elements, index-based    | C, C++, Java, Python    |
| Linked List | Dynamic size, each node points to next         | C, C++, Java            |
| Stack       | LIFO - Last In First Out                       | All major languages     |
| Queue       | FIFO - First In First Out                      | All major languages     |

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
| Structure   | Description                                    | Use Cases               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Tree        | Hierarchical data structure (e.g., binary tree)| File systems, databases |
| Graph       | Nodes connected by edges                       | Networks, social graphs |
| Heap        | Special tree for priority operations           | Priority queues         |
| Hash Table  | Key-value pairs with fast lookup               | Caching, dictionaries   |
